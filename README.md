Computer Audio Assignment 2

In this program we have shown basic implementation of the program based on Cooley Tuckey FFT algorithm

2 waveforms plot are generated as an output.

1st plot shows input signal while other shows the frequency peak generated in frquency domain.

I have taken 2 frequency bin values that will help us in generating the frequency signal.

1st value taken N=4 and it generate frequency peak of 2048 Hz.

2nd value taken N=32 and it generates frequency peak of 256 Hz.
